# HW1

## Devlog
1. Kai Meng, he/him
2. My Minigame breakdown document states that one of the player class's methods will instantiate a seed object. I also believed that the player class has a method which updates the UI text object.
These plans turned out to be true, as the Player class has a method called PlantSeed() which does both. 
I thought both the player and seed objects would have a sprite component, and the Player and seed objects do indeed have a sprite renderer component.
